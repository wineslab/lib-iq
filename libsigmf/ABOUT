libsigmf: https://www.deepsig.io/libsigmf

libsigmf is a free & opensource library for working with SigMF recordings.
(https://sigmf.org)

It was designed to enable the use of SigMF through static types in C++, thus
enabling things like compile-time errors and code inspection.

It was created and first authored by DeepSig Inc., and then released to
the community as an Apache 2.0-licensed FOSS project at FOSDEM 2019.
